 so as to minimize license text variation and make it easier for choosealicense.com to eventually consume license texts directly from SPDX.<br/><br/>The test could clone spdx/license-list-data and compare each license we have cataloged in this project. Many existing licenses would probably have to be marked as expected failures due to bugs in SPDX output and discrepancies in how this project has cataloged some licenses.

 about whether EUPL-1.1 is accurately described reminded me to file this enhancement idea.<br/><br/>For each license, license rules could be annotated with ranges of text in the license pertinent to the rule. Highlighting of ranges could be turned on/off on individual license pages by selecting in the license rules (permissions/conditions/limitations)
 table. Very crude mockup taking a very simple case (the one condition of MIT)
.<br/><br/>! <a href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/40415/16633043/25735510-437c-11e6-84f8-1e504d48f345.png">mit-highlight-condition</a> 

<br/><br/>Obviously this is not a big help for MIT, but for longer licenses, it can be tricky to figure out what bits of the license are pertinent for a particular rule, at least if you only want to read once, which is more already than I suspect most people do.<br/><br/>Such annotations _might_ be very helpful to \"demystify\" licenses, and creating them might be good QA for choosealicense.com license descriptions.<br/><br/>Probably the simplest way to to annotate would be to have one or more full text extracts for each license for each rule, though there are other ways to do it, inline or  <a href="https://github.com/hypothesis/h/wiki/robust-anchors">out of band</a>

From travis CI documents, I concluded that the individual tests may be exhausting resources of the container, and as such in https://github.com/github/octocatalog-diff/pull/161 I disabled the parallel_tests gem for CI. Since then, no problems. :crossed_fingers: But, unfortunately the CI build time per ruby version increased by about 5 minutes (20 to 25)
 as a result of this change.<br/><br/>I'm entering this issue to keep track turning this back on. Things that would probably need to be done here would be to evaluate whether the tests can be effectively parallelized (perhaps the spec tests)
 or if the number of simultaneous processes can be reduced to keep from bumping up against any limits that exist.<br/><br/>Right now nobody is actively working on this (there are higher priorities)
. However if test parallelization is something that interests you and you'd like to have a go at making the CI faster, please comment in the issue! 😸 " ]]></description></item><item>	<title>How to use a different puppet configuration (e.g. strict_variables)

. `git diff-tree` is used on `push`, `git diff` is used otherwise. A separate behaviour for push was added in #905 and follow-up #1049 to fix push to a default branch. But it seems working only in rare special cases: only one commit is pushed and no files are deleted. Otherwise wrong list is reported.<br/><br/>## Expected behavior<br/><br/>All changed non-deleted files from all commits added on top of the default branch should be checked, deleted files should be ignored.<br/><br/>## Steps to Reproduce<br/><br/>Here are the steps to reproduce within git (super-linter is not involved.<br/><br/>Adding first file, everything works fine:<br/>```bash<br/>+ git log --oneline master...465e71b<br/>465e71b (HEAD -> test)
 Add test1.txt<br/><br/>+ git diff-tree --no-commit-id --name-only -r 465e71b<br/>test/test1.txt<br/><br/>+ git diff --name-only master...465e71b --diff-filter=d<br/>test/test1.txt<br/>```<br/><br/>Now adding the second file in a separate commit, `diff git-tree` reports only the last file - only files changed in the last commit:<br/>```bash<br/>+ git log --oneline master...1c3d652<br/>1c3d652 (HEAD -> test)
 Add test2.txt<br/>465e71b Add test1.txt<br/><br/>+ git diff-tree --no-commit-id --name-only -r 1c3d652<br/>test/test2.txt<br/><br/>+ git diff --name-only master...1c3d652 --diff-filter=d<br/>test/test1.txt<br/>test/test2.txt<br/>```<br/><br/>Renaming first file, `git diff-tree` reports again only files from the last commit and as another issue - reports deleted file as well:<br/>```bash<br/>+ git log --oneline master...f5617a2<br/>f5617a2 (HEAD -> test)
 Rename test1.txt to test3.txt<br/>1c3d652 Add test2.txt<br/>465e71b Add test1.txt<br/><br/>+ git diff-tree --no-commit-id --name-only -r f5617a2<br/>test/test1.txt<br/>test/test3.txt<br/><br/>+ git diff --name-only master...f5617a2 --diff-filter=d<br/>test/test2.txt<br/>test/test3.txt<br/>```<br/><br/>Now deleting the second file, `git diff-tree` reports only this deleted file:<br/>```shell<br/>+ git log --oneline master...ee90eaf<br/>ee90eaf (HEAD -> test)
 Remove test2.txt<br/>f5617a2 Rename test1.txt to test3.txt<br/>1c3d652 Add test2.txt<br/>465e71b Add test1.txt<br/><br/>+ git diff-tree --no-commit-id --name-only -r ee90eaf<br/>test/test2.txt<br/><br/>+ git diff --name-only master...ee90eaf --diff-filter=d<br/>test/test3.txt<br/>```<br/><br/>## Additional context<br/><br/>Right now `git diff` command looks better for all cases except finding changes for a push to a `DEFAULT_BRANCH` (the case described in #900)
. I'd say `git diff` should be used instead of the other command, or `git diff-tree` needs to be called with a right list of parameters. <br/><br/>I don't have suggestions on how better to fix the original issue from #900. If there needs to be a special code condition for that case maybe it should be checking not only git `push` event but also if current branch is a `DEFAULT_BRANCH`. <br/><br/>This project really needs testing for the \"get diff files list\" behaviour. It was broken couple of times already. Having wrong files checked is really disappointing. What makes it even more disappointing is that you often don't even realize this. With current broken behaviour wrong files were linted in the last 3 months when `push` event was used. I believe that's quite a lot of people and projects since this setup is recommended by super-linter readme :cry: <br/><br/>Additional tough thing is that it's impossible to debug \"get diff files list\" in local, since `VALIDATE_ALL_CODEBASE=true` behaviour is used in that case.
