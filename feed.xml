Many existing licenses would probably have to be marked as expected failures due to bugs in SPDX output and discrepancies in how this project has cataloged some licenses.

 about whether EUPL-1.1 is accurately described reminded me to file this enhancement idea.<br/><br/>For each license, license rules could be annotated with ranges of text in the license pertinent to the rule. Highlighting of ranges could be turned on/off on individual license pages by selecting in the license rules (permissions/conditions/limitations)
 table. Very crude mockup taking a very simple case (the one condition of MIT)
.<br/><br/>! <a href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/40415/16633043/25735510-437c-11e6-84f8-1e504d48f345.png">mit-highlight-condition</a> 

<br/><br/>Obviously this is not a big help for MIT, but for longer licenses, it can be tricky to figure out what bits of the license are pertinent for a particular rule, at least if you only want to read once, which is more already than I suspect most people do.<br/><br/>Such annotations _might_ be very helpful to \"demystify\" licenses, and creating them might be good QA for choosealicense.com license descriptions.<br/><br/>Probably the simplest way to to annotate would be to have one or more full text extracts for each license for each rule, though there are other ways to do it, inline or  <a href="https://github.com/hypothesis/h/wiki/robust-anchors">out of band</a>

 of the article would you like to see updated?<br/><br/>The article suggests installing the `gh-actions-cache` extension for the GitHub CLI. However, recent versions of the GitHub CLI have the `gh cache` extension (https://github.com/cli/cli/pull/7403)

, so it's probably best to use the `gh cache` subcommand instead of the `gh actions-cache` extension.<br/><br/>### Additional information<br/><br/>[Maintainer edit]<br/>Anyone can make the update to use `gh cache` but include the information that they should make sure to have version >= 2.32.0 of the CLI (https://github.com/cli/cli/releases/tag/v2.32.0)

It mentions this is an extension of markdown, but doesn't clarify in what contexts it should work.  At least it doesn't work in github project readme.md files.<br/><br/>Additionally I would say screenshots shouldn't be used as the rendering example.
