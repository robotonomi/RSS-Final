<br/><br/>One way it can be improved is to include some \"yes/no/undefined\" check-boxes along the top of the table.<br/>When you eg: check the box above: \"Same License\" it brings all \"same licenses\" to the top &amp; grays out all other licenses.<br/>* If you check several boxes, only those licenses with ALL checked conditions are highlighted.<br/>* Below those (partially grayed out, or something)
 are licenses that partially match the check-boxes (in decreasing number of matches)
.<br/>* And below that too is the remaining licenses, totally grayed out.<br/><br/>That would make this page awesome to use.<br/>Thanks &amp; hope this helps." ]]></description></item><item>	<title>Test that license texts match SPDX plain license texts</title>	<link>https://github.com/github/choosealicense.com/issues/636</link>	<description><![CDATA[We should have a test that each license text in `_licenses` is the same as the plain text license in the SPDX collection to automate the requirement described at https://github.com/github/choosealicense.com/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-a-license<br/><br/>> The text of the license should match the corresponding text found in  <a href="https://github.com/spdx/license-list-data/blob/master/text/">spdx/license-list-data</a> 

. If there are errors there, please fix them in  <a href="https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML">spdx/license-list-XML</a> 

 (from which the plain text version is generated)
 so as to minimize license text variation and make it easier for choosealicense.com to eventually consume license texts directly from SPDX.<br/><br/>The test could clone spdx/license-list-data and compare each license we have cataloged in this project. Many existing licenses would probably have to be marked as expected failures due to bugs in SPDX output and discrepancies in how this project has cataloged some licenses. But we should address upfront for any new license cataloged here, and continue to chip away at the existing inconsistencies." ]]></description></item><item>	<title>Annotating license texts with license rules</title>	<link>https://github.com/github/choosealicense.com/issues/441</link>	<description><![CDATA[ <a href="https://github.com/github/choosealicense.com/pull/320#issuecomment-230746990">Comment/question today</a> 

 about whether EUPL-1.1 is accurately described reminded me to file this enhancement idea.<br/><br/>For each license, license rules could be annotated with ranges of text in the license pertinent to the rule. Highlighting of ranges could be turned on/off on individual license pages by selecting in the license rules (permissions/conditions/limitations)
 table. Very crude mockup taking a very simple case (the one condition of MIT)
.<br/><br/>! <a href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/40415/16633043/25735510-437c-11e6-84f8-1e504d48f345.png">mit-highlight-condition</a> 

<br/><br/>Obviously this is not a big help for MIT, but for longer licenses, it can be tricky to figure out what bits of the license are pertinent for a particular rule, at least if you only want to read once, which is more already than I suspect most people do.<br/><br/>Such annotations _might_ be very helpful to \"demystify\" licenses, and creating them might be good QA for choosealicense.com license descriptions.<br/><br/>Probably the simplest way to to annotate would be to have one or more full text extracts for each license for each rule, though there are other ways to do it, inline or  <a href="https://github.com/hypothesis/h/wiki/robust-anchors">out of band</a>

It could be great to get a report of all licenses checks in an XML formatted file; so we can process it using Jenkins plugins. For now, I have to analyse the `XXX dependencies checked, XXX warnings found.` string formatted output of `licensed status` command.<br/><br/>We can consider **licensed results** as **tests results**.<br/>* If all licenses check passed; then the overall test is **passed**.<br/>* If one license is found as unknown, or not matching any of allowed, ignored or reviewed configs; then the check/test **failed**.<br/><br/>Standards test output formats such as junit, nunit, mstest, google-test, etc. would be great cos already known by many CI tools. Junit is probably the most used one.<br/><br/>Organizing tests in \"groups\" matching the package type (npm, pip, go, etc.)
 and license type (mit, gpl...)

From travis CI documents, I concluded that the individual tests may be exhausting resources of the container, and as such in https://github.com/github/octocatalog-diff/pull/161 I disabled the parallel_tests gem for CI. Since then, no problems. :crossed_fingers: But, unfortunately the CI build time per ruby version increased by about 5 minutes (20 to 25)
 as a result of this change.<br/><br/>I'm entering this issue to keep track turning this back on. Things that would probably need to be done here would be to evaluate whether the tests can be effectively parallelized (perhaps the spec tests)
 or if the number of simultaneous processes can be reduced to keep from bumping up against any limits that exist.<br/><br/>Right now nobody is actively working on this (there are higher priorities)
. However if test parallelization is something that interests you and you'd like to have a go at making the CI faster, please comment in the issue! ðŸ˜¸ " ]]></description></item><item>	<title>How to use a different puppet configuration (e.g. strict_variables)

The idea in this PR is to fix this issue by running `golangci-lint` on whole directories instead of singular files, when `VALIDATE_ALL_CODEBASE == false` and recursively on the whole repo otherwise.<br/><br/>Feedback is greatly appreciated on all points, but especially on the following:<br/><br/>- The array of go files to analyze will potentially contain multiple repeated entries. To get rid of them I am using the following commnad: `  mapfile -t FILE_ARRAY_GO < <(printf '%s\<br/>' \"${FILE_ARRAY_GO[@]}\" | sort -u)
` Any suggestion on better approaches from more experienced bash developers is highly appreciated.<br/>- With this solution, the number of errors reported by SuperLinter will be always heavily underestimated. If running against all codebase, it will at most be 1; otherwise, it will be at most 1 for every directory analysed. Please note that, however, at the moment the number of errors is already not exactly the number of errors found by the linter but only the number of files with one or more errors (example  <a href="https://github.com/bznein/AoC2019-Go/runs/834384999?check_suite_focus=true">here</a>
