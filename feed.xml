Since it needs to run on all comments &amp; comment edits, every time another bot such as Netlify updates a comment -which is _very often_ in auto-deploys!- the workflow runs. We filed https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/8205 on ourselves to disable the action on bots. <br/><br/>Can I suggest having the README.md / first-run docs for accessibility-alt-text-bot disable the workflow for bot accounts?<br/><br/>There's something funny about the default docs of an action authored in the GitHub organization causing many many more workflow GitHub Action runs to take up more of GitHub's $." ]]></description></item><item>	<title>üêõ Bug: No fallback behavior for action runs on forks</title>	<link>https://github.com/github/accessibility-alt-text-bot/issues/44</link>	<description><![CDATA[When this action runs on a fork and doesn't have permissions to fetch comments _(am I using the right terminology?)

<br/><br/>One way it can be improved is to include some \"yes/no/undefined\" check-boxes along the top of the table.<br/>When you eg: check the box above: \"Same License\" it brings all \"same licenses\" to the top &amp; grays out all other licenses.<br/>* If you check several boxes, only those licenses with ALL checked conditions are highlighted.<br/>* Below those (partially grayed out, or something)
 are licenses that partially match the check-boxes (in decreasing number of matches)

. If there are errors there, please fix them in  <a href="https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML">spdx/license-list-XML</a> 

 (from which the plain text version is generated)
 so as to minimize license text variation and make it easier for choosealicense.com to eventually consume license texts directly from SPDX.<br/><br/>The test could clone spdx/license-list-data and compare each license we have cataloged in this project. Many existing licenses would probably have to be marked as expected failures due to bugs in SPDX output and discrepancies in how this project has cataloged some licenses. But we should address upfront for any new license cataloged here, and continue to chip away at the existing inconsistencies." ]]></description></item><item>	<title>Documentation for `X-GitHub-SSO` is suspicious</title>	<link>https://github.com/github/docs/issues/31661</link>	<description><![CDATA[### Code of Conduct<br/><br/>- [X] I have read and agree to the GitHub Docs project's  <a href="https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">Code of Conduct</a>

 of the article would you like to see updated?<br/><br/>The code samples explain how to use bash or PowerShell to set variables and such, but don't explain the concept of the environment files very well. There is no need to do this explicitly in Bash or PowerShell, one can do it from msbuild or C# or a node script once you understand how it works.<br/><br/>I propose to either add a separate page or a paragraph in the \"environment files\" section, explaining the underlying concept of the `$GITHUB_OUTPUT` variable containing the file name in which these output variables are stored. And that `\"a-b\">>$GITHUB_OUTPUT` basically appends a line to the bottom of that file. And to document that that file needs to be written in utf-8 encoding.<br/><br/>That way you can easily translate that to C#, or msbuild, or python or java or node or go or anything else. Any tool that runs inside the workflow can interact with the agent in this way.<br/><br/>### Additional information<br/><br/>_No response_" ]]></description></item><item>	<title>\"Ensure entries are GitHub Orgs\" takes a long time to run, surfaces problems unrelated to changes in a given PR</title>	<link>https://github.com/github/government.github.com/issues/1265</link>	<description><![CDATA[- [ ] run \"Ensure entries are GitHub Orgs\" on all entries periodically (weekly?)

From travis CI documents, I concluded that the individual tests may be exhausting resources of the container, and as such in https://github.com/github/octocatalog-diff/pull/161 I disabled the parallel_tests gem for CI. Since then, no problems. :crossed_fingers: But, unfortunately the CI build time per ruby version increased by about 5 minutes (20 to 25)
 as a result of this change.<br/><br/>I'm entering this issue to keep track turning this back on. Things that would probably need to be done here would be to evaluate whether the tests can be effectively parallelized (perhaps the spec tests)
 or if the number of simultaneous processes can be reduced to keep from bumping up against any limits that exist.<br/><br/>Right now nobody is actively working on this (there are higher priorities)
. However if test parallelization is something that interests you and you'd like to have a go at making the CI faster, please comment in the issue! üò∏ " ]]></description></item><item>	<title>How to use a different puppet configuration (e.g. strict_variables)

They did not actually catch any bugs; the best thing they did was expose some very weird behavior in certain functions, ones that we were unable to change (without huge renovations)
