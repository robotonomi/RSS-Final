 are licenses that partially match the check-boxes (in decreasing number of matches)

 (from which the plain text version is generated)
 so as to minimize license text variation and make it easier for choosealicense.com to eventually consume license texts directly from SPDX.<br/><br/>The test could clone spdx/license-list-data and compare each license we have cataloged in this project. Many existing licenses would probably have to be marked as expected failures due to bugs in SPDX output and discrepancies in how this project has cataloged some licenses. But we should address upfront for any new license cataloged here, and continue to chip away at the existing inconsistencies." ]]></description></item><item>	<title>bug: documentation on saved searches may be out of date</title>	<link>https://github.com/github/docs/issues/27444</link>	<description><![CDATA[### Code of Conduct<br/><br/>- [X] I have read and agree to the GitHub Docs project's  <a href="https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">Code of Conduct</a>

 of the article would you like to see updated?<br/><br/>Currently, step 4 (more on this a little later ðŸ˜„)
 reads as follows:<br/><br/>> If you click again on the search bar, you can now see your saved search in the \"Saved searches\" section under the search bar. Clicking on a saved search entry will add the query to the search bar and filter the suggestions accordingly.<br/>To edit a saved search, in the \"Saved searches\" section, click to the right of the saved search.<br/>To delete a saved search, click to the right of the saved search.<br/><br/>This does not match the recently updated UI. When I first focus on the search field, the saved search is listed as a suggestion by default.<br/><br/>! <a href="https://github.com/github/docs/assets/10350960/14e0cd44-4962-4cf3-b1f9-480620619122">Screenshot that shows the saved search as an autocomplete suggestion in the suggestions list.</a> 

<br/><br/>When I type `saved:` the UI updates to only show my saved searches and surfaces the \"Manage saved searches\" option.<br/><br/>! <a href="https://github.com/github/docs/assets/10350960/6a852ab2-36c5-48c0-83e6-efd7ea4cfc5c">Screenshot demonstrating the updated UI with an option to manage saved searches.</a>

This list the users saved searches, and for each entry, it shows options to edit or delete a saved search.</a> 

<br/><br/>> Related: I opened this discussion because a saved search I have shows up under saved searches, but selecting the saved search triggers an error. https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/63708<br/><br/>## Sidenote<br/><br/>Concerning step 4. Steps one to three are concerned with creating a saved search, and step four is concerned with managing an existing saved search. These feel like separate workflows and are not part of the same sequential steps. It will become clearer with the suggested updates above, so I recommend separating them into two separate ordered lists.<br/><br/>> NOTE: Please let me know if I should separate some of the above into separate issues.

From travis CI documents, I concluded that the individual tests may be exhausting resources of the container, and as such in https://github.com/github/octocatalog-diff/pull/161 I disabled the parallel_tests gem for CI. Since then, no problems. :crossed_fingers: But, unfortunately the CI build time per ruby version increased by about 5 minutes (20 to 25)
 as a result of this change.<br/><br/>I'm entering this issue to keep track turning this back on. Things that would probably need to be done here would be to evaluate whether the tests can be effectively parallelized (perhaps the spec tests)
 or if the number of simultaneous processes can be reduced to keep from bumping up against any limits that exist.<br/><br/>Right now nobody is actively working on this (there are higher priorities)
. However if test parallelization is something that interests you and you'd like to have a go at making the CI faster, please comment in the issue! ðŸ˜¸ " ]]></description></item><item>	<title>How to use a different puppet configuration (e.g. strict_variables)

. If the app is already running in the background we'll get an error because the kext only allows one connection. This error is surfaced to the user, which is confusing. We should not connect to the kext unless we need to." ]]></description></item><item>	<title>The run-name suggestion creates improper indentation</title>	<link>https://github.com/github/vscode-github-actions/issues/240</link>	<description><![CDATA[**Describe the bug**<br/>A clear and concise description of what the bug is.<br/><br/>**To Reproduce**<br/>In a workflow accept the `run-name` suggestion<br/><br/>**Expected behavior**<br/>The indentation will be correct and not buggy <br/><br/>**Screenshots**<br/><br/>https://github.com/github/vscode-github-actions/assets/85468376/38209d6c-e6b1-44e0-a7dd-2089ebcd22b9<br/><br/>" ]]></description></item><item>	<title>\"Context access might be invalid\" warning thrown for repository variables and secrets</title>	<link>https://github.com/github/vscode-github-actions/issues/222</link>	<description><![CDATA[**Describe the bug**<br/>After upgrading to 0.25.8, a \"Context access might be invalid\" warning is thrown for all repository variables and secrets in the workflow file.
