Since it needs to run on all comments &amp; comment edits, every time another bot such as Netlify updates a comment -which is _very often_ in auto-deploys!- the workflow runs. We filed https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/8205 on ourselves to disable the action on bots. <br/><br/>Can I suggest having the README.md / first-run docs for accessibility-alt-text-bot disable the workflow for bot accounts?<br/><br/>There's something funny about the default docs of an action authored in the GitHub organization causing many many more workflow GitHub Action runs to take up more of GitHub's $." ]]></description></item><item>	<title>üêõ Bug: No fallback behavior for action runs on forks</title>	<link>https://github.com/github/accessibility-alt-text-bot/issues/44</link>	<description><![CDATA[When this action runs on a fork and doesn't have permissions to fetch comments _(am I using the right terminology?)

I prefer to view summaries of licenses on your website, so it's helpful to be able to jump to the page for a specific license.<br/><br/>Implementation options:<br/>* A basic search bar which loads a search result page is minimum<br/>* Ajax live search (i.e., autocomplete/search suggestions)

<br/><br/>One way it can be improved is to include some \"yes/no/undefined\" check-boxes along the top of the table.<br/>When you eg: check the box above: \"Same License\" it brings all \"same licenses\" to the top &amp; grays out all other licenses.<br/>* If you check several boxes, only those licenses with ALL checked conditions are highlighted.<br/>* Below those (partially grayed out, or something)
 are licenses that partially match the check-boxes (in decreasing number of matches)
.<br/>* And below that too is the remaining licenses, totally grayed out.<br/><br/>That would make this page awesome to use.<br/>Thanks &amp; hope this helps." ]]></description></item><item>	<title>More sophisticated example for `hashFiles` function</title>	<link>https://github.com/github/docs/issues/32305</link>	<description><![CDATA[### Code of Conduct<br/><br/>- [X] I have read and agree to the GitHub Docs project's  <a href="https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">Code of Conduct</a>

From travis CI documents, I concluded that the individual tests may be exhausting resources of the container, and as such in https://github.com/github/octocatalog-diff/pull/161 I disabled the parallel_tests gem for CI. Since then, no problems. :crossed_fingers: But, unfortunately the CI build time per ruby version increased by about 5 minutes (20 to 25)
 as a result of this change.<br/><br/>I'm entering this issue to keep track turning this back on. Things that would probably need to be done here would be to evaluate whether the tests can be effectively parallelized (perhaps the spec tests)
 or if the number of simultaneous processes can be reduced to keep from bumping up against any limits that exist.<br/><br/>Right now nobody is actively working on this (there are higher priorities)
. However if test parallelization is something that interests you and you'd like to have a go at making the CI faster, please comment in the issue! üò∏ " ]]></description></item><item>	<title>How to use a different puppet configuration (e.g. strict_variables)
</title>	<link>https://github.com/github/octocatalog-diff/issues/158</link>	<description><![CDATA[Hey, I have set `strict_variables` (https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/4.10/configuration.html#strictvariables)
 to true on the puppetmaster. Now I also want this setting to be there for the octocatalog-diff run. Unfortunately I couldn't figure out how I could do that. The only think I could think of would be to add a bootstrapping script which creates a puppet.conf with that setting. But this doesn't feel right :)
<br/><br/>Does someone has an idea how I could do that?" ]]></description></item><item>	<title>Remove typed-paths interface and use FilePath for everything</title>	<link>https://github.com/github/semantic/issues/673</link>	<description><![CDATA[Though FilePath is very flawed, especially on Windows, typed paths were a failed experiment. They did not actually catch any bugs; the best thing they did was expose some very weird behavior in certain functions, ones that we were unable to change (without huge renovations)
 lest command-line invocations break. There is a new FilePath type coming, one based on ShortByteString and officially blessed by a GHC working group, and we should just switch back to FilePath so that we can transition to that when possible." ]]></description></item><item>	<title>Caching</title>	<link>https://github.com/github/setup-licensed/issues/159</link>	<description><![CDATA[Have you considered caching the binary so it runs faster?

. This also happens when the app is launched from the command line (Eg. for deleting/listing registrations)
. If the app is already running in the background we'll get an error because the kext only allows one connection. This error is surfaced to the user, which is confusing.
