<br/><br/>One way it can be improved is to include some \"yes/no/undefined\" check-boxes along the top of the table.<br/>When you eg: check the box above: \"Same License\" it brings all \"same licenses\" to the top &amp; grays out all other licenses.<br/>* If you check several boxes, only those licenses with ALL checked conditions are highlighted.<br/>* Below those (partially grayed out, or something)
 are licenses that partially match the check-boxes (in decreasing number of matches)
.<br/>* And below that too is the remaining licenses, totally grayed out.<br/><br/>That would make this page awesome to use.<br/>Thanks &amp; hope this helps." ]]></description></item><item>	<title>Test that license texts match SPDX plain license texts</title>	<link>https://github.com/github/choosealicense.com/issues/636</link>	<description><![CDATA[We should have a test that each license text in `_licenses` is the same as the plain text license in the SPDX collection to automate the requirement described at https://github.com/github/choosealicense.com/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-a-license<br/><br/>> The text of the license should match the corresponding text found in  <a href="https://github.com/spdx/license-list-data/blob/master/text/">spdx/license-list-data</a> 

. If there are errors there, please fix them in  <a href="https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML">spdx/license-list-XML</a> 

 (from which the plain text version is generated)
 so as to minimize license text variation and make it easier for choosealicense.com to eventually consume license texts directly from SPDX.<br/><br/>The test could clone spdx/license-list-data and compare each license we have cataloged in this project. Many existing licenses would probably have to be marked as expected failures due to bugs in SPDX output and discrepancies in how this project has cataloged some licenses. But we should address upfront for any new license cataloged here, and continue to chip away at the existing inconsistencies." ]]></description></item><item>	<title>[Improvement]: Make JWT examples more practical</title>	<link>https://github.com/github/docs/issues/30766</link>	<description><![CDATA[### Is this issue for a product update or release that is not yet available to customers?<br/><br/>No?

From travis CI documents, I concluded that the individual tests may be exhausting resources of the container, and as such in https://github.com/github/octocatalog-diff/pull/161 I disabled the parallel_tests gem for CI. Since then, no problems. :crossed_fingers: But, unfortunately the CI build time per ruby version increased by about 5 minutes (20 to 25)
 as a result of this change.<br/><br/>I'm entering this issue to keep track turning this back on. Things that would probably need to be done here would be to evaluate whether the tests can be effectively parallelized (perhaps the spec tests)
 or if the number of simultaneous processes can be reduced to keep from bumping up against any limits that exist.<br/><br/>Right now nobody is actively working on this (there are higher priorities)
. However if test parallelization is something that interests you and you'd like to have a go at making the CI faster, please comment in the issue! ðŸ˜¸ " ]]></description></item><item>	<title>How to use a different puppet configuration (e.g. strict_variables)
</title>	<link>https://github.com/github/octocatalog-diff/issues/158</link>	<description><![CDATA[Hey, I have set `strict_variables` (https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/4.10/configuration.html#strictvariables)
 to true on the puppetmaster. Now I also want this setting to be there for the octocatalog-diff run. Unfortunately I couldn't figure out how I could do that. The only think I could think of would be to add a bootstrapping script which creates a puppet.conf with that setting. But this doesn't feel right :)
<br/><br/>Does someone has an idea how I could do that?" ]]></description></item><item>	<title>Remove typed-paths interface and use FilePath for everything</title>	<link>https://github.com/github/semantic/issues/673</link>	<description><![CDATA[Though FilePath is very flawed, especially on Windows, typed paths were a failed experiment. They did not actually catch any bugs; the best thing they did was expose some very weird behavior in certain functions, ones that we were unable to change (without huge renovations)
 lest command-line invocations break. There is a new FilePath type coming, one based on ShortByteString and officially blessed by a GHC working group, and we should just switch back to FilePath so that we can transition to that when possible." ]]></description></item><item>	<title>Caching</title>	<link>https://github.com/github/setup-licensed/issues/159</link>	<description><![CDATA[Have you considered caching the binary so it runs faster?
